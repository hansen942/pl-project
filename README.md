# A Small Functional Language
The goal of the project is to build a small ml-like functional language that is strongly typed and supports type inference, polymorphism, recursion, etc.
Some other cool features I am thinking of adding include Haskell-style functors and monad syntax (maybe do notation).
## Status
I began by implementing an evaluator for the applied lambda calculus with integers and booleans.
Then I made it simply typed and added recursive functions.
Recently, I implemented prenex polymorphism and type inference as well as type classes, and have begun work to add product and sum types and recursive types.
Hopefully I will get around to adding a Lexer and Parser at some point.
